# I didn't write a script to pull individual rankings yet
# Instead, I went to the page of rankings I wanted, opened my console to the Network tab,
# and just copied and pasted the response from 
# https://api.chambers.com/api/subsections/<id>/individual-rankings?multi-language=true
# into a json file
